**Effective date:** December 24, 2025  
**Publisher:** Yashwanth Krishna (independent developer) ("Publisher", "we", "us")  
**Support contact:** `pyashwanthkrishna@gmail.com`

This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") governs your use of the Img Crafter AI add-on ("Add-on") within Adobe Express. By installing, accessing, or using the Add-on, you agree to this Agreement.

#### 1) Relationship to Adobe Express and third parties

The Add-on runs inside Adobe Express. Your use of Adobe Express is governed by Adobe's terms and policies. The Add-on also integrates with third-party services (such as OpenAI and Dodo Payments) whose terms may apply to those services.

#### 2) License grant

Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, Publisher grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Add-on for your personal or business use inside Adobe Express.

#### 3) Restrictions

You may not (and may not allow anyone else to):

- Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive the Add-on source code except where permitted by law.
- Bypass or tamper with credit checks, purchase flows, pricing logic, security controls, or usage limits.
- Use the Add-on to create, edit, extract, or distribute content that is illegal, fraudulent, harmful, abusive, or that infringes others' rights.
- Upload content you do not have the legal right to use (including copyrighted, confidential, or private content without permission).
- Use the Add-on for malware, exploitation, scraping, or disruptive activity.

#### 4) Your content (prompts, images, files)

"User Content" means the text prompts, images, and other materials you submit to the Add-on.

You represent and warrant that:

- You have all necessary rights and permissions to provide User Content.
- Your User Content and use of the Add-on comply with law and do not violate third-party rights.

You grant Publisher a limited right to process User Content solely to operate and provide the Add-on features (including transmitting it to AI providers to produce outputs).

#### 5) AI outputs (generated images, edits, extracted text)

The Add-on uses AI services to generate "Outputs." You understand that:

- Outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, offensive, or not fit for your intended purpose.
- You are responsible for reviewing Outputs before use and for ensuring your use complies with law and third-party rights (copyright, trademark, privacy/publicity, etc.).
- Publisher does not guarantee that Outputs are original, non-infringing, or usable for any specific purpose.

#### 6) Credits, pricing, and purchases

Some features require credits.

- **Credits and deductions:** The Add-on will check your credit balance and deduct credits for operations (generation/edit/upscale/OCR) based on the pricing shown in the UI at the time you run the action.
- **Welcome credits:** The Add-on may grant a one-time welcome bonus (e.g., free credits for new users).
- **Purchases:** If you purchase credits, checkout and payment processing are handled by Dodo Payments and its partners. After successful payment, credits are added to your wallet (sometimes after a short delay due to webhook processing).
- **No chargebacks/fraud:** Attempted fraud, abuse, or reversal of payments may result in loss of credits, suspension of purchase capability, or blocked access where necessary to protect the service.
- **Refunds:** Purchases are final except where required by law or where the payment provider processes a refund. If a refund occurs, Publisher may adjust/withdraw credits that were granted for that purchase.

#### 7) Availability and changes

Publisher may update, modify, suspend, or discontinue the Add-on (or parts of it) at any time, including changing credit pricing, models, limits, or features. This may be necessary due to cost, provider changes, security, or compliance.

#### 8) Termination

You can stop using the Add-on at any time. Publisher may suspend or terminate access if:

- You violate this Agreement,
- Your use creates security, legal, or operational risk,
- Required to comply with law or platform/provider requirements.

Upon termination, your license ends and you must stop using the Add-on.

#### 9) Third-party services disclaimer

The Add-on depends on third-party services (including OpenAI and Dodo Payments). Publisher does not control those services and is not responsible for their outages, errors, pricing changes, or policies. Your use of third-party services may be subject to their terms.

#### 10) Disclaimer of warranties

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE ADD-ON IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." PUBLISHER DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. PUBLISHER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE ADD-ON WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR THAT OUTPUTS WILL BE ACCURATE OR SAFE.

#### 11) Limitation of liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, PUBLISHER WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, GOODWILL, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE ADD-ON OR THIS AGREEMENT.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, PUBLISHER'S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS IN ANY 12‑MONTH PERIOD WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR CREDITS THROUGH THE ADD-ON IN THAT PERIOD (IF ANY).

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in that case, these limits apply only to the extent permitted by law.

#### 12) Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold Publisher harmless from claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from:

- Your User Content,
- Your misuse of the Add-on,
- Your violation of this Agreement or third-party rights.
