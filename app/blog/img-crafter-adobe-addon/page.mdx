# Img Crafter: When Adobe Believed in Our Vision

Sometimes the best outcomes aren't the ones you expected. We entered the Adobe Express Hackathon with **Img Crafter**, an AI-powered add-on that brings Generate, Edit, and Mimic workflows into a single sidebar. We didn't win the competition—but something even better happened. **Adobe saw the potential in our project and funded us to bring it to life.**

That vote of confidence pushed us to go beyond a hackathon prototype. We polished every feature, squashed every bug, and shipped a **working product** that now runs inside Adobe Express. This is the story of how Img Crafter came to be.

## The Hackathon Journey

After we settled on the idea of **Img Crafter**, our first step was researching whether it could actually work as an Adobe Express Add-on. Once we confirmed the technical feasibility, we spent a week writing, editing, and polishing our three-minute pitch video.

When the video was ready, we still had extra time and were eager to **bring the idea to life**. We sketched out mockups, mapped the user interface, and chose our tech stack. Then, thankfully, Adobe extended the deadline by a week—the perfect opportunity to start building.

We dove into coding each feature: **Generate, Edit, Mimic**, and building a responsive front-end interface. We spent the final days on deployment, faced errors along the way, but worked through every single one. Now we have a **working prototype** running in Adobe Express.

## What Is Img Crafter?

Img Crafter is an AI-powered add-on for Adobe Express that brings three powerful workflows—**Generate, Edit, and Mimic**—into a single sidebar. With clear controls, instant previews, and built-in versioning, you can:

- **Create** new artwork from text descriptions
- **Refine** existing images with simple instructions
- **Apply and extract** artistic styles

All without ever leaving Adobe Express.

## How It Works

### 1. Generate Tab

The **Generate** tab turns plain-language descriptions into original images. No design experience needed—just type what you want, tweak a few settings, and let OpenAI's **GPT-Image-1 API** do the rest.

**Features:**
- **Prompt Input**: Natural-language description for any image
- **Style Selector**: Photographic, digital art, vector illustration, and more
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square, landscape, or portrait
- **Variations Slider**: Generate 1–3 unique versions
- **Add to Canvas**: Insert directly into Adobe Express

**Example**: Type "whimsical birthday card with balloons and cake," choose Vector Illustration, and get colorful greeting card designs ready to use.

#### Built-in Edit Mode

Click **Edit** to open a clean editing interface. Describe changes like "change background to red" or "make the guitar black"—each change creates a new version instead of replacing the old one (**branching**), so you never lose earlier work.

### 2. Edit Tab

The **Edit** tab is your all-in-one tool for improving or transforming any image.

#### Normal Edit
Describe adjustments in plain English—"remove the background," "add brighter highlights"—and receive a freshly edited image.

#### Upscale
Increase resolution and clarity for printing or large-format displays while preserving sharpness.

#### Extract Text
Uses **Gemini 2.5 Pro Flash API** to read printed or handwritten text from images. Perfect for menus, documents, or handwritten notes.

### 3. Mimic Tab

The **Mimic** tab helps you apply or recreate artistic styles effortlessly.

#### Transform Image
Transfer the look of one picture—colors, textures, art style—to another. It's like painting your photo in the style of any reference artwork.

**Example**: Upload Van Gogh's Starry Night as a style reference, add any landscape, and get a swirling, painterly version.

#### Generate New
Combine a style reference with a fresh prompt to create entirely new images that match both the visual mood and your description.

**Example**: Upload a Studio Ghibli frame, type "A floating library in the clouds," and get a dreamy illustration in that animation style.

#### Color Palette
Extract dominant colors from any image with typography suggestions for headings, subheadings, and body text.

### AI Models Used

1. **GPT-Image-1 (OpenAI)** — Powers all image generation across Generate, Edit, and Mimic tabs
2. **Gemini 2.5 Pro Flash** — Handles accurate text extraction from images

### Deployment

Img Crafter is **fully deployed** as a private Adobe Express Add-on. All features—Generate, Edit, Mimic—are functional and being refined based on real usage.

## What We Built

With Adobe's funding, we went all the way and shipped a complete product:

-  **Credit-based system** for quality tiers (Low/Medium/High)
-  **User authentication** and persistent settings
-  **Monetization** through credit packages

Adobe's support gave us the runway to build something real. We didn't win the hackathon—but we shipped a fully functional, production-ready product. And that feels like the real victory.
